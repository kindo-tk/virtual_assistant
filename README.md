## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/kindo-tk/virtual_assistant.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd .\virtual_assistant\
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

## Usage

3. Give voice commands to perform various tasks.
4. To exit give stop as command.

## Note

1. **API Keys:**
   - Please use your own API keys for the news and weather APIs. Replace the placeholders in the code with your own API keys to access these services.

2. **Speech Recognition:**
   - Sometimes the assistant may have difficulty recognizing speech accurately. If you encounter recognition issues, try speaking clearly and ensure there is minimal background noise. Additionally, you can adjust the microphone settings for better recognition.

3. I have added an executable file <a href ="https://github.com/kindo-tk/voice_assistant/blob/main/Pogo.exe">`pogo.exe`</a> that allows you to use the voice assistant directly without any installation process.(your antivirus may show this as a threat, but it is completely safe).

## Area of Improvement:

One area for potential improvement is the integration of OpenAI into Pogo. Incorporating OpenAI would enhance Pogo's capabilities, making it a true AI assistant with advanced natural language understanding and more powerful features. However, this is currently limited by the paid nature of the APIs.
